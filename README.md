Insulin_PK_prediction
==============================

Project for predicting insulin PK parameters. 
Python notebooks and scripts are found in "notebooks" **see Readme within "notebook" folder for precise explanation of scripts and how to run them.** 
Main data pkl file is "full_data_set.csv" and can be found in /data/processed/
